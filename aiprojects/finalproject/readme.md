# Tickr - CSC3335 Spring 22' Final Project

## Instructions to run the program.
---
See requirements.txt for a complete overview of all the libraries that were in the environment used to develop the project.

Please run the project through workflow.py, which is the main class. 

WARNING I: it will take a LONG time doing web scraping and tweet retrieval, maybe hours. We would recommend leaving that part commented, as it currently is, and using the data that we have provided after doing the scraping and Twitter retrievals on our own (see project demo).

WARNING II: the web scraping part was built using Selenium webdriver for Microsoft Edge, but it can be changed to Firefox at your discretion. If you intend to do so, please see the comments in files scraper.py and in clustering.py. Additionaly, please download the geckodriver.exe from the following URL: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases, and put it in the project folder.

When the program runs and completes every single step, it will output a URL (http://127.0.0.1:8050/) so that you can just click on it and you will be able to open the dashboard in your browser.

Please see Slides-Presentation.pdf for further explanation.
