2021/05/11, VIDEO2:2302:23JPMorgan is bullish on Chinese tech stocks. Here's whyStreet Signs AsiaJPMorgan Asset Management is bullish on Chinese technology stocks even though regulators are cracking down on internet giants in the mainland.Shares of major Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, JD.com and Meituan have tumbled this year as Beijing moved to rein in monopolistic behavior among internet giants.   Howard Wang, head of Greater China equities at JPMorgan Asset Management, said the regulatory clampdown poses uncertainties in the near term. But in the longer term, Chinese tech companies still have the potential to grow, he said.  "If we look at these fundamentals, and you stretch over a longer period of time, I think we're actually in a pretty good buying spot," Wang told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Tuesday.Wang said price declines in Chinese tech shares — due to the regulatory risks or investors rotating out of growth stocks — appear overdone. That has resulted in "pretty decent value" in some Chinese tech stocks, he added.Without naming specific stocks, Wang said he likes large tech companies given their beaten down valuation and potential for earnings to grow.Shares of tech giant Alibaba in Hong Kong fell around 7.48% this year as of Monday's close. E-commerce companies JD.com and Meituan have dropped around 16% and 10.8%, respectively.From our standpoint as investors, it's kinda really just hunkering down, looking at the fundamentals, making sure your companies aren't doing anything that will be construed as unfair market practice...Howard Wanghead of Greater China equities, JPMorgan Asset ManagementWang said Chinese tech firms could still face a bumpy road in the next few months as the regulatory clampdown continues. But the crackdown has so far been "rational," he added."From our standpoint as investors, it's kinda really just hunkering down, looking at the fundamentals, making sure your companies aren't doing anything that will be construed as unfair market practice — at least not currently," said Wang."I think when we take that into context ... it actually looks like a decent environment to be investing in these stocks. Tough over the next few weeks, but overall these are the kinds of investments that you'd want to make in China," he added.

2021/04/30, Avishek Das | LightRocket | Getty ImagesRobinhood, the free-trading app that helped drive a surge in retail investing during the pandemic, has switched to using JPMorgan Chase to handle crucial money transfers into customers' accounts.The start-up emailed customers this week to say it is now using JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, to process transactions for cash management accounts. It had previously used Ohio-based Sutton Bank, a community lender with eight branches."This change is part of a larger effort to make a more consistent and reliable experience, and it will enhance our ability to meet your cash management needs," Robinhood said in the email.The move illustrates the ways in which traditional banks are competing with and enabling the new guard of fintech players like Robinhood, which has quickly amassed more than 13 million users drawn to free trades and a slick interface. JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon has repeatedly warned shareholders that fintech and Big Tech players are encroaching on his industry's territory."Many of these new competitors have done a terrific job in easing customers' pain points and making digital platforms extremely simple to use," Dimon said this month in his annual investor letter. "From loans to payment systems to investing, they have done a great job."While JPMorgan is happy to provide financial plumbing-type services to Robinhood – and is pushing to provide it additional services in the payments realm – the bank also competes with the upstart.Online brokerages across the industry ultimately adopted Robinhood's no-commission stance, and JPMorgan offers free unlimited trades via its own mobile app. Robinhood and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.JPMorgan's wholesale payments business, run by Takis Georgakopoulos, won the Robinhood business last year and recently began taking over accounts, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Last year, his business also took on Coinbase and Gemini, two leading bitcoin exchanges, as payments-processing clients.The payments deal is part of a web of connections between Robinhood and traditional lenders. Robinhood relies on banks including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for massive commercial credit lines to fund corporate activities.The latest development comes as investment banks including JPMorgan jockey for lucrative roles in the upcoming Robinhood initial public offering. Last month, Robinhood said it had filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO that could come late in the second quarter.While Robinhood's last fundraising pegged its valuation at $11.7 billion, trading of private shares indicated it could be valued as much as $40 billion in an IPO, according to Bloomberg.The retail investing boom that Robinhood helped usher in, combined with trillions of dollars in government stimulus, has resulted in a surge in new customers and trading volume for brokerages this year.  Become a smarter investor with CNBC Pro. Get stock picks, analyst calls, exclusive interviews and access to CNBC TV. Sign up to start a free trial today.

2021/04/27, The JP Morgan Chase & Co. headquarters, The JP Morgan Chase Tower in Park Avenue, Midtown, Manhattan, New York.Tim Clayton - Corbis | Corbis Sport | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase is summoning its U.S. employees back to the office, at least on a part-time basis.The biggest U.S. bank by assets told workers on Tuesday it is ramping up the numbers of employees allowed in offices and that buildings will be open to all employees on May 17, subject to a 50% building occupancy limit."We would fully expect that by early July, all U.S.-based employees will be in the office on a consistent rotational schedule, also subject to our current 50% occupancy cap," the bank said in a memo, reported earlier by Bloomberg News. "With this timeframe in mind you should start making any needed arrangements to help with your successful return."JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a webcast last week that the company couldn't yet require employees to be vaccinated before returning to the office. The company has had some employees working from offices for most of the pandemic, especially those in trading roles, but it has long planned on moving to a rotational model to allow workers flexibility.Citigroup's head of human resources said last month in a blog post that up to 30% of workers would be back in North American offices starting in July and more colleagues would join in September. Here is the JPMorgan memo:Dear colleagues,Throughout the pandemic, our buildings and branches in the U.S. have remained open and have safely operated for our essential employees, to whom we remain incredibly grateful. In our previous message, we said that we were looking forward to having more of you back in the office during the spring and summer months. As the U.S. surpasses its goal of more than 200 million COVID-19 vaccinations administered and more cities and states lift restrictions, we will open our U.S. offices to all employees on Monday, May 17 subject to our current 50% occupancy cap.We are welcoming more of you back next month so that you can get comfortable with being back in an office environment. Understanding that this may take some time, we would fully expect that by early July, all U.S.-based employees will be in the office on a consistent rotational schedule, also subject to our current 50% occupancy cap. With this timeframe in mind you should start making any needed arrangements to help with your successful return. Each line of business will work with their managers and location leaders to determine an appropriate schedule. Our branches and offices outside of the U.S. will continue to follow their established processes.As we welcome you back in the coming months, you should be confident that we will continue to:Follow all government restrictions and mandates and be prepared to pause or reverse your return if needed.Maintain a 50% occupancy cap — at least until the CDC revises its social distancing guidelines.Practice our industry-recognized health and safety protocols, including our high standards of cleaning and air filtration, mask wearing and daily health check requirements.Provide information and resources to help you get vaccinated because we know that getting vaccinated means less risk of spreading the virus to our families, friends and colleagues. It is also important to note that while we strongly encourage you to get vaccinated, a vaccination is not required in order to return to the office at this time.Provide training and resources to help you navigate the new office environment.We know that many of you are excited to come back, but we also know that for some, the idea of coming in on a regular basis is a change through which you'll need to manage. Please start to discuss your return with your manager and make necessary arrangements.More details on returning to the office will be provided in the coming days and weeks to help you prepare.

2021/04/28, J.P. Morgan Wealth Management ad campaign launching in April.YouTubeJPMorgan's wealth management unit is launching a major ad campaign as it tries to endear itself to younger investors. It's the first multichannel ad campaign from the group since the company folded up certain wealth management operations into a unit back in December 2019. That unit includes its branch- and office-based financial advisors, remote advice, and its self-directed investing and automated investing offerings.The wealth management unit's CEO, Kristin Lemkau, told Barron's earlier this month that it's aiming to double the number of Chase deposit clients that invest with the wealth management unit. The company wouldn't share a timeline for that goal.It also comes during a hot period for retail investing, with major online brokers including Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade and Robinhood seeing activity surge. Charles Schwab added a record 3.2 million new clients in the first quarter of 2021, more new accounts than in all of 2020. JPMorgan declined to share the number of its self-directed investing or automated investing clients.Dipti Kachru, chief marketing officer of the U.S. wealth management group, said JPMorgan has strong brand awareness and credibility, but that many younger investors see the brand as being out of reach for themselves. "We know we're dealing with a perception where we're not accessible for younger investors. We want to change that," Kachru said. She said the campaign also seeks to reinforce what the wealth management unit is and drive growth.Some of the messaging goes for an aspirational feel — some digital ads have messages like, "The life you envision is our life's work." Others describe offerings like its advisors, showing customers walking into a branch and speaking to one of them. The company, which worked with WPP agency Swift on the campaign, said it seeks to reach more than 30 million U.S. consumers with the campaign via TV, video, social, audio and digital display ads."It was important for us to not just say what we're going to do, but show how we do it, and clearly demonstrate it," Kachru said. "It is a fairly sort of cluttered and commoditized space. … How do we bring 200 years of expertise and credibility in this space, our investment in technology and digital and make that work in service of the client in a more personal way? That's sort of the thread that binds the work together." Kachru said the campaign attempts to catch the eye of both those who are completely new to investing and those who may be more mature investors who work with other companies but might be looking for more personalized advice. "We know that there's work to be done in making more customers aware of how we can serve them in the market, a lot of whom actually have a relationship with us at Chase today," she said. Those customers might have a deposit account or credit account with Chase, but are investing with another company, she said. "There's inherent benefits of expanding their relationship with us, specifically in bringing the investing part of the story seamlessly into the app that they're engaging with every day." VIDEO2:3202:32Jim Cramer on retail investors using Covid stimulus checks to buy stocksSquawk on the Street

2021/04/23, U.S. President Joe Biden holds a bi-partisan meeting on the American Jobs Plan at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 19, 2021.Kevin Lemarque | ReutersThe one-two punch of rising interest rates and higher taxes will make it harder for the bull market to maintain its traction, JPMorgan strategists said Friday.The stock market suffered an intraday swoon on Thursday on reports that President Joe Biden was planning to hike the capital gains tax on the wealthiest Americans. The tax hike would be part of Biden's larger push for infrastructure and social welfare spending and comes along with a proposed corporate tax hike.Interest rates have also risen this year, though the move has cooled in recent weeks. JPMorgan's equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said in a note to clients that yields should move higher again and put short-term pressure on the market, with the potential tax hikes looming as a longer-term risk.

2021/04/23, In this articleJPMVIDEO1:0201:02J.P. Morgan apologizes for its role in Super League for soccerClosing BellJPMorgan said on Friday it regretted supporting soccer clubs in launching a breakaway European Super League after the plan collapsed earlier this week due to a storm of protest from fans and politicians."We clearly misjudged how this deal would be viewed by the wider football community and how it might impact them in the future," a representative for the bank said."We will learn from this."JPMorgan provided a 3.5 billion euro ($4.2 billion) grant to the founding clubs to spend on infrastructure and recovery from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The bank was the sole lender to the new soccer competition which was masterminded by Real Madrid's president Florentino Perez.The financing package was key to helping Perez win the trust of other major European clubs and draft a binding agreement that would commit an overall twelve clubs including Juventus, Manchester United, Liverpool and Barcelona to the new tournament, aimed at increasing revenues.But the plan collapsed on April 21— less than 48 hours from being announced — with eight of the 12 founding members from England, Italy and Spain walking away under massive pressure from fans, politicians, soccer officials and even the British royal family.JPMorgan also faced criticism for its role in funding the rebel clubs as football fans immediately took to Twitter calling for a boycott of the Wall Street bank."We will avoid any businesses or financial products that JPMorgan have their grubby little paws in," an angry fan tweeted on April 19.The bank also had its corporate sustainability rating downgraded by Standard Ethics over its role in financing the new soccer competition.The reputational damage comes as JPMorgan's boss Jamie Dimon has repeatedly called for companies to consider the needs of workers, communities and customers as well as those of shareholders."Capitalism must be modified to do a better job of creating a healthier society, one that is more inclusive and creates more opportunity for more people," he said in an open letter to Time magazine in 2020.

2021/04/21, FireEye information analysts work at the company's office in Milpitas, California.Beck Diefenbach | ReutersInvestors weighing strategies that consider a company's environmental, social and governance policies should turn their attention to cybersecurity, according JPMorgan.This is especially true in the wake of work-from-home policies and high-profile data breaches — including the SolarWinds hack — which can cause a stock to sell-off and inflict reputational damage on the company. The bank categorizes cybersecurity under the "social" factor of ESG investing.When assessing the potential threat of a cyber attack, investors need to consider certain factors, including a company's geographical footprint, the firm said."Investors typically examine a company's policies on data protection and information security systems as a way to assess a firm's cybersecurity risks," JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients. "However, this is incomplete without factoring in geographical and geopolitical data. Foreign territories can initiate cyberattacks on organizations" the firm said.As companies beef up their security spending, JPMorgan highlighted several stocks that stand to benefit.

2021/04/15, In this articleJPMPedestrians walk in front of the JPMorgan Chase headquarters building in New York.Scott Mlyn | CNBCJPMorgan Chase said Thursday it will commit more than $2.5 trillion over the next decade toward long-term solutions that tackle climate action and contribute to sustainable development.Within the initiative, $1 trillion is earmarked for green projects, including renewable energy and clean technologies that are focused on speeding the transition to a low-carbon economy.The $2.5 trillion target, which begins this year and runs through the end of 2030, will also finance and facilitate transactions that support socioeconomic progress in developing countries, as well as economic inclusion in developed markets.The latter effort will focus on small business financing, home lending and affordable housing, education and health care. Included within this category is the $30 billion JPMorgan committed last October to closing the racial wealth gap in the U.S."Climate change and inequality are two of the critical issues of our time, and these new efforts will help create sustainable economic development that leads to a greener planet and critical investments in underserved communities," CEO Jamie Dimon said."Business, government and policy leaders must work together to support long-term solutions that advance economic inclusion, bolster sustainable development and further the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are committed to doing our part," he said.Thursday's announcement comes after JPMorgan said last fall it will establish emission targets for its financing portfolio. The firm said targets would be set on a sector-by-sector basis, and will first focus on the oil and gas, electric power, and automotive manufacturing sectors.The targets, which the firm said it would begin setting in 2021, will be within the parameters outlined by the 2015 Paris Agreement.Dimon also addressed the enormous opportunity created by the energy transition in his 2020 annual letter to shareholders."There's huge opportunity in sustainable and low-carbon technologies and businesses," he said."While many of these technologies and companies are mature, many more are just getting started—and more will need to be created in the coming decades. In addition, all companies will need capital and advice to help them innovate, evolve and become more efficient while staying competitive in a changing world," Dimon said in the letter.The bank facilitated in 2020 more than $220 billion in transactions related to sustainable development, more than $55 billion of which was for green initiatives. The total exceeded the firm's initial $200 billion target for the year.Some believe the bank has not done enough.A recent report from a collection of climate organizations found that between 2016 — the first full year after the Paris Agreement was signed — and 2020, JPMorgan's total fossil fuel financing hit $317 billion. That's more than any of the major banks.Citi and Wells Fargo were the second- and third-largest financers at $237 billion and $223 billion, respectively.While JPMorgan still tops the list, the bank — which is the largest by assets under management in the U.S. — has decreased its lending since the Paris Agreement was signed, according to the report.A representative from the firm previously said that the bank does not comment on third-party reports.Citi also announced heighted sustainable finance goals on Thursday, saying that it will commit $1 trillion by 2030."We will finance and facilitate a wide array of climate solutions — from renewable energy and clean technology, to water conservation and green buildings, to sustainable agriculture and land use — and will further accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy that balances the environmental, social and economic needs of society," the bank said in a blog post.— CNBC's Hugh Son contributed reporting.Enjoyed this article?For exclusive stock picks, investment ideas and CNBC global livestreamSign up for CNBC ProStart your free trial now

2021/04/14, In this articleJPMVIDEO4:1204:12Hightower's Stephanie Link reacts to JPMorgan's earnings beatSquawk BoxJPMorgan Chase on Wednesday reported profit and revenue that exceeded analysts' expectations on robust trading results and a $5.2 billion benefit from releasing money it had previously set aside for loan losses that didn't develop.The bank posted first-quarter profit of $14.3 billion, or $4.50 a share including a $1.28 per share benefit from the reserve release, higher than the $3.10 per share expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Excluding the impact of a $550 million charitable contribution, which lowered earnings by 9 cents, the bank earned an adjusted figure of $4.59, exceeding the $3.10 estimate.Companywide revenue of $33.12 billion exceeded the $30.52 billion estimate, driven by the firm's trading operations, which produced about $1.8 billion more revenue than expected.JPMorgan's release of $5.2 billion in reserves is the biggest sign yet that the U.S. banking industry is now expecting to have fewer loan losses than it did last year, when it set aside tens of billions for defaults anticipated from the coronavirus pandemic. A year ago, the firm had added $6.8 billion to credit reserves."Overall, this was a great quarter for JPMorgan," said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy Opimas. "It is now increasingly clear that the bank over-reserved, and that money is now flowing back into its earnings, concealing some of the weakness in consumer banking."JPMorgan shares dipped less than 1%.Fixed income trading produced $5.8 billion in revenue, a 15% increase that exceeded analysts' estimates by more than $800 million, on activity in securitized products and credit markets. Equities trading revenue surged 47% to $3.3 billion, a full $1 billion more than estimates, on "strong performance across products."JPMorgan, with the world's biggest Wall Street bank by total revenue, was expected to benefit from robust investment banking fees driven by record issuance of special purpose acquisition companies, which saw more activity in the first quarter than all of 2020, itself a record year.That came to pass: The firm said first-quarter investment banking revenue surged 222%, or a full $2 billion, to $2.9 billion, exceeding the estimate of $2.65 billion.Most of the quarter's reserve release came from the bank's retail division: The firm said $3.5 billion was tied to the bank's credit card borrowers, and another $625 million from home loan borrowers.While that meant that the firm's consumer and community banking division saw profit surge by $6.5 billion from a year earlier, to $6.73 billion, the bank said that card and mortgage revenue was impacted by lower balances as flush consumers pay down their debts.In the release, CEO Jamie Dimon called loan demand "challenged," but during a call with reporters Wednesday, Dimon added that the dynamic would ultimately be good for loan demand because consumers were in good shape.Dimon struck an optimistic tone for the near-term economic future in the U.S., similar to comments he made this month in his annual shareholder letter."With all of the stimulus spending, potential infrastructure spending, continued quantitative easing, strong consumer and business balance sheets and euphoria around the potential end of the pandemic, we believe that the economy has the potential to have extremely robust, multi-year growth," Dimon said in the release.Analysts will also be curious about the pace of share repurchases the bank is expected to make. Last month, the Federal Reserve said banks that pass the industry's 2021 stress test at mid-year will be allowed to resume higher levels of dividend payouts and buybacks starting June 30.Shares of JPMorgan rose 21% so far this year, compared to the 25% advance of the KBW Bank Index.After JPMorgan's earnings statement, Goldman Sachs also released first-quarter results that crushed forecasts with record first-quarter net profits and sales due to strong performance in trading and investment banking.Here are the JPMorgan numbers:Earnings: $4.59 per share vs. $3.10 per share expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.Revenue: $33.12 billion vs. $30.52 billion expected.Enjoyed this article?For exclusive stock picks, investment ideas and CNBC global livestreamSign up for CNBC ProStart your free trial nowCorrection: JPMorgan's EPS figure comparable to estimates has been adjusted 9 cents higher to account for a one-time charitable contribution.

2021/04/20, Marko KolanovicCrystal Mercedes | CNBCOne of Wall Street's top strategists who's nailed the markets' moves during the pandemic said the reopening trade is not over and is instead about to kick into gear once again.Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan's chief global markets strategist, said in a note on Tuesday that the recent pullback in areas like cyclical stocks (names linked to overall economic growth) and Treasury yields will soon prove to be temporary. Reopening trades and interest rates rose steadily from late last year into March as investors bet on the U.S. economic recovery, but those trades have cooled off in recent weeks

2021/04/09, JPMorgan building in New York.Scott Mlyn | CNBCJPMorgan Chase boosted the number of Black and female college students selected for investment bank internships by leaning on technology platforms that help the firm broaden out its campus recruiting efforts, CNBC has learned.The company said that 18% of its corporate and investment bank summer interns in North America are Black this year, a 64% increase from 2020, when the level was 11%, according to figures provided by New York-based JPMorgan. The bank also said female interns make up 55% of the 2021 class globally, from 50% last year.The move at JPMorgan could ultimately begin to change the composition of Wall Street, which for decades has been mostly a bastion for white males, particularly in senior roles. Banks like JPMorgan, which hires about 1,000 summer interns globally, use the programs to vet and train students to become entry-level bankers when they graduate.One reason the bank is making progress has been the use of two software programs that help recruiters sift through more candidates than previously was the case, according to Rob Walke, global head of campus recruiting for the corporate and investment bank."We've really opened up the way that we hire," Walke said Thursday in a Zoom interview. The intern selection process "should be based upon your skills, your previous experiences and your ability to articulate your competencies for the role, rather than us assuming them based upon the school you're studying at."The bank used to focus campus recruiting primarily on 17 or 18 of the most prestigious universities including Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, he said. While students from those schools are still highly sought after, the process often led to candidates with a similar background to employees who had previously graduated from the schools.Video gamesA few years ago, JPMorgan began piloting the use of computer games called pymetrics that aim to objectively measure "cognitive, social and behavioral attributes" of candidates. Hoping to reduce bias in the interview process, the bank also began using a video program called HireVue to automate the first round of candidate interviews.By widening the number of schools it recruits from and creating relationships with historically Black colleges and universities, the bank has been able to select more minorities: Black students will make up 29% of interns in sales and research roles, 24% in global markets roles and 13% of investment-banking interns, JPMorgan said.The firm made similar progress in its asset and wealth management division, which will have 17% Black student interns this year, from 7% in 2020.Most summer interns typically get offered full time positions as first-year analysts when they graduate, according to Walke. The program begins in June and, unlike last year, when the coronavirus pandemic forced interns to work remotely, most investment banking internships will be in person at JPMorgan offices.  If the bank is able to retain its Black talent through the first few rungs of the Wall Street hierarchy – analysts rise to become associates, and some eventually get promoted to the vice president title – the move should eventually result in more minorities at higher levels in the organization.Other banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have made similar diversity pledges. In 2019, Goldman set "aspirational goals" of having half of all new analysts and entry-level associates hired in the U.S. be women, 11% Black, and 14% Latino. Then, last year Goldman said it would double hiring of junior bankers from Black colleges by 2025.Still mostly whiteBut often the challenge in large organizations is in nurturing minorities and women so that some do ultimately rise in the ranks to become senior managers, acknowledged Brian Lamb, JPMorgan's head of Diversity & Inclusion.To further that cause, the bank has created groups of senior leaders that engage with new hires to help form a sense of community internally, and made diversity and inclusion targets a part of executives' performance and pay evaluations, Lamb said.Still, as is the case at other banks, most of JPMorgan's executive ranks are white. In the U.S., 83% of the bank's operating committee is white, while 79% of the executive team is white, according to an annual disclosure. In the three years since 2018, the ranks of Black employees in mid-level and higher management positions has mostly stayed flat, along with the total workforce level of 13% for Black employees.It's at the first rung of the banking hierarchy, the campus recruiting level, that's seen progress: JPMorgan said 58% of the 2020 class were minorities including Blacks, Asians and Hispanics; that figure should rise this year."What's important is the trajectory," Lamb said. "Are we seeing gains like we have in the campus recruiting data? Are we seeing year-over-year improvements of women representation and ethnic representation? We're encouraged by the progress, but there's still plenty of work to do."Enjoyed this article?For exclusive stock picks, investment ideas and CNBC global livestreamSign up for CNBC ProStart your free trial now

Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City.Mike Segar | ReutersJPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon outlined his vision for a post-pandemic work culture in his annual shareholder letter, and while the Wall Street bank chief is bullish on the outlook for the U.S. economy after Covid-19, he walked a fine line between embracing remote work and worrying about the risks the employment shift could pose long-term."While working from home will become more permanent in American business, it needs to work for both the company and its clients," Dimon wrote.Dimon outlined several reasons why workers will be coming back to the office, from jobs that simply cannot be done remote — employees in retail bank branches, jobs in check processing, vaults, lockbox, sales and trading, critical operations functions and facilities, amenities, security, medical staff and "many others," he wrote — to broader concerns about the future of company competitiveness with too much of its workforce at home.The CNBC @Work Summit returnsThis fall, October 13, Facebook CIO Atish Banerjea, Bank of America Chief Operations and Technology Officer Cathy Bessant, WeWork CEO Sandeep Mathrani and Estee Lauder CFO Tracey Travis will talk building a resilient future and more. Register now.His model for JPMorgan envisions "many employees" working in a location full time; "some employees" working under a hybrid model which allows them to split days between a work location and a home; and only "a small percentage of employees, maybe 10%, will possibly be working full time from home for very specific roles," according to the letter.Corporate battle lines in post-pandemic workAs major corporations begin to be forced to walk-the-walk of permanent post-pandemic work cultures, differences are emerging in the approach from some of the biggest employers in the U.S., part of a push and pull between offering employees more flexibility in a tight talent market, while ensuring competitive advantages in an era of rapid innovation and market share reshuffling.Microsoft has been very clear on its WFH policy since October 2020: up to 50% work from home without manager approval required. Some firms from within the tech and financial sectors, such as Facebook, Twitter and Synchrony Financial, announced permanent remote work flexibility early in the pandemic.But there are corporate giants at the other end of the spectrum. Google announced a much less liberal WFH policy, saying last week that employees will have a maximum of 14 days WFH annually and, beyond that, manager approval will be required. On Wall Street, Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon recently called WFH an "aberration," and some Wall Street firms, including Goldman and JPMorgan, are planning to bring interns back to the office this summer.Last August, Daniel Pinto, a top Jamie Dimon lieutenant at the corporate and investment banking arm of the company, which employs over 60,000 people, outlined for CNBC the company's emerging view of a new "rotational" model that would allow some employees to be working "one week a month from home, or two days a week from home, or two weeks a month."At a recent CNBC @Work summit discussion with Microsoft chief people officer Kathleen Hogan, she said: "I definitely would be thoughtful about if you can't enable hybrid, having a really good reason why it's really important for people to be in the office 9-5."  Dimon referred to virtually functioning "with Zoom and Cisco" during the pandemic as something JPMorgan learned could maintain productivity, "at least in the short run."Remote work's 'serious' weaknessesDimon made a point that several other companies have stressed about the limitations of virtual work: that it is better for teams formed before the pandemic than for new employees."It does not work as well when people don't know one another," he wrote in the letter.Learning from others as an apprentice "is almost impossible to replicate in the Zoom world" and he worries this could "dramatically undermine" the character and culture a company is attempting to build.Dimon also said a "heavy reliance" on Zoom meetings slows down decision making because follow up does not occur as quickly."And remote work virtually eliminates spontaneous learning and creativity because you don't run into people at the coffee machine, talk with clients in unplanned scenarios, or travel to meet with customers and employees for feedback on your products and services," Dimon wrote, echoing many concerns of C-suite executives about the collaboration and the "serendipity" that occurs in workplaces.Office real estate will shrinkOne change that will be occurring of significance is less bank corporate real estate.Dimon said JPMorgan will "quickly" move to a more open seating arrangement and digital technology will be used to manage seating and conference rooms. He estimated that for every 100 employees, the bank will need seats for 60, on average. "This will significantly reduce our need for real estate," he wrote.But similar to other major employers continuing with New York City commercial real estate plans, such as Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google, JPMorgan still intends to build its new headquarters in New York City, while consolidating "even more" employees into the building, which will house between 12,000 to 14,000 employees."It's in the best location in one of the world's greatest cities," Dimon wrote.At the same time, he used the annual letter to argue against efforts to make SALT (state and local) tax deductions unlimited, a proposed change to the 2017 tax law which would benefit states like New York and its high-income earners, but which Dimon noted are deductions that accrue at a level of 80% to people earning more than $339,000 a year.

He now thinks per share earnings will jump by a median 80% compared to the first quarter of 2020, when banks were forced to set aside money for expected loan losses.

Second, pension funds and endowment funds are requesting that their asset managers take ESG factors into account during the investment process.A worker wearing a protective mask attends to basil plants at the ComCrop rooftop farm in Singapore, on Wednesday, May 27, 2020.Lauryn Ishak | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWu said Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund integrated sustainability and ethical practices in 2017, and that sent a "ripple effect" through the industry."We think that's going to continue for the rest of the region," she said.Sustainability trendsWu also weighed in on key trends in sustainable investments in Asia."What you're going to see is the 'E' pillar of ESG … gaining importance," she said referring to the environmental criteria.Wu pointed out that South Korea, Japan and China have made commitments to achieve net zero carbon emissions — China has targeted to reach carbon neutrality by 2060."That's going to create a massive shift in the way China uses energy," she said. The country will need to cut down its reliance on coal from around 60% to around 2% or 3%, she said."In its place, we're going to see renewable power capacity growing by folds," she said."Within renewable power, solar power generation is going to be doubling in the next five years," she predicted.

2021/03/12, In this articleJPMVIDEO3:4203:42JPMorgan expects cyclical and defensive stocks to lead market higher in the medium termStreet Signs AsiaInvestment bank JPMorgan expects cyclical stocks to lead the market higher in the medium- to long-term as the business cycle improves."You're going to see cyclicals and more defensive names continue the rally after we get past this period of adjustment," said James Sullivan, head of Asia ex-Japan equity research at JPMorgan.Cyclical stocks are companies whose underlying businesses tend to follow the economic cycle of expansion and recession. Some of these include sectors such as finance, energy and industrial. Defensive stocks — such as health care and consumer staples — typically provide consistent earnings and dividends regardless of stock market conditions.Global stock markets wobbled in recent weeks as bond yields rose, driven by optimism in the vaccine rollout for Covid-19 and the resumption of consumption spending.The move fueled expectations of higher inflation and investors worried it would prompt central banks to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates can knock down stocks with relatively high valuations.A foreign currency dealer looks at a monitor in a dealing room.SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInterest rates concerns also accelerated a market rotation — as investors took money out of expensive tech and growth stocks and put them into other cyclical sectors such as finance, energy and industrial. Stocks have rebounded in recent sessions but analysts still expect market conditions to remain volatile."What we've seen is a very, very sharp rebound in value, you're likely to see a bounce in growth as a result of the extremity of that market move," he said Wednesday on CNBC's "Street Signs Asia.""On a medium-to-long term basis, though, we still see cyclicals and defensives leading this market higher," Sullivan added.JPMorgan positive on financials, consumer stocksSteepening of the yield curve is positive for the overall profitability of large financial institutions, Sullivan explained, adding that the investment bank is overweight for both the banking and insurance sectors. Financial companies typically benefit from rising interest rates as it expands their profit margin.A steepening yield curve occurs when rates for longer dated bonds rise faster than interest rates for shorter dated bonds and typically indicates that investors expect rising inflation and stronger economic growth.JPMorgan is also positive on consumer stocks, according to Sullivan. "We are seeing very strong consumption trends across the board," he said, adding the bank "would be positive on both financials and consumer as a result."As economies around the world reopen, consumption spending is expected to resume on the back of better growth prospects and stimulus measures. Overnight in the U.S., President Joe Biden signed a massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that will put cash into the hands of Americans.Tech: Valuations 'reasonably high'Technology stocks were a big beneficiary in the markets last year as the coronavirus pandemic knocked global growth off track due to lengthy lockdowns around the world. Investors and traders, who typically turn to less risky assets in order to weather the market volatility, poured money into tech and software stocks which benefited from the lockdown."Overall tech leadership of markets was taken to an extreme last year," Sullivan said, adding that despite some of the recent sell off in tech names, "we are seeing valuations that are reasonably high."JPMorgan's argument is that within the tech space, investors should rotate out of platform names and move into companies that sell software as a service and into the semiconductor space given the ongoing global chip shortage."We don't necessarily see the large platforms leading these markets higher for the rest of this year," Sullivan added.

2021/02/22, In this articlePLTRJPMZanbato Mountain View OfficeSource: ZanbatoJPMorgan Chase is taking a stake in a private stock trading platform with links to Palantir to boost the bank's efforts to connect buyers and sellers of hot pre-IPO company shares, CNBC has learned.The bank's investment in Zanbato, a Mountain View, California-based fintech start-up, is set to be announced Monday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Zanbato was co-founded in 2010 by Joe Lonsdale, the entrepreneur who also co-founded data analytics firm Palantir.The move is the first in a series of investments JPMorgan may make in trading venues and exchanges that help the bank access data and prices in the burgeoning and fragmented market for private company securities, according to Andrew Tuthill, global head of private market equities.In the six months since JPMorgan began trading the stock of private firms — a market that includes giant companies like SpaceX, Robinhood and Stripe — the new business has experienced torrid growth. Order flow and demand from trading counterparties has roughly doubled every month since CNBC first reported on the operation in September, said Tuthill."It's been a big growth area for the firm," he said during an interview.Interest in pre-IPO companies has surged in recent years, luring JPMorgan into an area that had been the domain of smaller, West Coast-based players. That's partly because venture capital investors have plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into private companies in the past decade, allowing them to remain private for far longer than used to be the case. Venture-backed firms were valued at more than $2 trillion last year, according to PitchBook data.So at the same time that hedge funds and family offices in search of returns increasingly look to snap up shares of private firms, executives and early investors in start-ups are also seeking to sell positions that they've held for years, according to Zanbato CEO Nico Sand.Nico Sand, CEO and co-founder of Zanbato.Source: Zanbato"Companies are staying private for so long that some of these early investors are up 10X-plus on a position," Sand said in an interview. "Being able to manage oversized positions, these are things that every manager has done forever, but in private markets you just never had the liquidity to employ these basic portfolio management techniques" until now, he said.The Zanbato platform, which is called ZX and was launched in 2016, has more than 100 banks and brokers as members, giving it a reach in private stock trading that no single company could match, even one as large as JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets.JPMorgan's investment is the first by a bank member of the ZX platform, and Zanbato will likely allow more of its members to make investments in the coming years, Sand said.The start-up has seen its user base more than double in the past year, while transaction volumes more than tripled, said Sand, who co-founded Zanbato in Silicon Valley along with Lonsdale and lead engineer Kevin Leung. Most ZX members saw record levels of private stock trading last year, he said.Private companies that are larger in valuation, have been around for many years and have a diverse set of investors are likely to be the most heavily traded names, Sand added.The investment shows that JPMorgan is willing to lean on external, tech-powered providers when it comes to serving its trading and wealth management clients rather than building all of its capabilities internally. The companies wouldn't disclose the size of the stake or how much JPMorgan paid.While trading in private shares is still mostly a manual process where closing a transaction can take weeks, start-ups like Zanbato are seeking to increase standardization in the nascent market. That will eventually help the onset of automation and speed the time to close deals, just as technology has collapsed the time to trade in public equities."One of the things we say in the private market is that time is the enemy of every deal," Tuthill said. "Zanbato creates efficiency in execution which hopefully decreases the time it takes to get a deal closed."

2021/02/23, In this articleJPMJamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co.Giulia Marchi | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase on Tuesday announced its latest round of initiatives to support banks and credit unions that are primarily owned or directed by people of color, as well as banking institutions that work with underserved communities.It's part of JPMorgan's $30 billion commitment to help address wealth inequality."These new initiatives are focused on strengthening minority-owned and diverse-led financial institutions by providing additional access to capital, connections to institutional investors, specialty support for Black-led commercial projects and mentorship and training opportunities," the bank said in a news release.JPMorgan announced its initiative last October, following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has also highlighted longstanding systemic health and social inequities."Systemic racism is a tragic part of America's history," Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said in a statement at the time. "We can do more and do better to break down systems that have propagated racism and widespread economic inequality, especially for Black and Latinx people."Historically, banks have contributed to inequality through now-banned practices such as redlining. JPMorgan's peers, such as Bank of America and Citigroup, also made billion-dollar commitments to reduce inequality.As part of its latest slew of efforts, JPMorgan Chase said it's invested and committed the first $40 million of its $50 million equity pledge to Black and Latinx-led minority depository institutions.The firm added that it's also established a racial equity program, by providing New Markets Tax Credit investment pricing for Black-led, Black-owned and Black-serving nonprofits and businesses. This tax credit provides investors a tax incentive for investing in low-income communities. JPMorgan said it will help direct financing from the tax credit to community projects, including shelters, healthcare clinics and small businesses.The bank is also launching "Empowering Change," which it called a "unique program supported by Google and in partnership with minority depository institutions and diverse-led community development financial institutions to provide economic opportunity to underserved communities.""Google is anchoring the program's launch with an intent to invest $500 million in the Empower money market share class that will be initially distributed by diverse-led MDIs The Harbor Bank of Maryland, Liberty Bank and Trust, M&F Bank and Unity National Bank," the company said.JPMorgan said the program includes a new Empower money market share class for distribution by MDIs and diverse-led CDFIs, as well as an annual donation of 12.5% of revenue received from the management fees on Empower share class assets to support community development.The bank will also provide access to its resources, including training and education.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
