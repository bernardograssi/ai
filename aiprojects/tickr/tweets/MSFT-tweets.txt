2021-05-10 @Gamers4LMedia @CommonGuy69 @CloudStrifeVIIR @DualSenseDude Again, we're discussing the brand of Xbox. Microsoft is rich off other products especially comupter related. Of course they make a profit of something, but just profiting doesn't mean it's enough. Xbox is in a bad spot and you're defending them for no good reason.

2021-05-10 @GamerChild12 @IGN The Xbox Series X has nothing on the PS5'S SSD. Plus, Microsoft is purposefully holding themselves back by making every xbox series x exclusive compatible with xbox one. So they won't even try to push their console to its limit like Sony did with the ps4 and will do with ps5.
2021-05-10 @Gamers4LMedia @CommonGuy69 @CloudStrifeVIIR @DualSenseDude No, you posted revenue. It clearly states revenue. They make money back from games, licensing, software, etc. Of course they do. But the profit for the Xbox brand is not something Microsoft is proud of, which is why they hide their real numbers.

2021-05-10 If anyone can help me I would really appreciate it:There's a game I played a bunch on Xbox 360 called ilomilo. I own it on the Microsoft Store on PC. However, whenever I launch it, it downloads my save data from the cloud and I have NO WAY of disabling. I want to start fresh.
2021-05-10 @AbyssalPen @Rolivhuwa @ErikRicardo01 @IGN @Microsoft Oh I'm not saying it's ideal, I'm not an expert either but the guys that make the games are, the would test it to see what's possible. PES 2014 and Metal Gear 5 use the same engine.There's a lot of possibilities with a good engine.

2021-05-10 @mieckfram @IGN @Microsoft It's more because I've seen how this can go wrong, and I'm a little skeptical. Maybe lazy isn't a good word for it, but it just feels like a strange decision to use a racing game's engine for an action adventure RPG like Fable. How will the physics of the engine play into it?

2021-05-10 @Ayemucker @Rolivhuwa @ErikRicardo01 @IGN @Microsoft Because I have to question how well the gameplay style of Fable is going to translate into the Forza engine. I'm not an expert on game development, by any means, but it just seems like a really odd choice of engine for a third person action RPG, given Forza's physics engine.

2021-05-10 @ErikRicardo01 @IGN @Microsoft I get that, and I think its smart of them, finance wise, to make this move, it's just that recent years have had a few solid examples of games that were made using another franchise's engine that just didn't pan out, and I'm worried that will happen here. Physics gonna be üëå tho.

2021-05-09 Jason Crawford makes a pretty strong argument here that IBM is the most innovative company in computing's history, and I certainly agree vis-a-vis his comparators: "Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon or Google.".  But I think there are at least two other strong contenders.

Maybe Qualcomm wants to keep it a secret.

2021-05-09 @itzjeremy @VIPOSA1 @xboxBG Very ignorant statement. Microsoft has been an advocate for the preservation of old games from the very beginning and every Xbox starting with the 360 has had back compat. It's not like MS is just now focusing on it, they've been investing in back compat since 2005.
2021-05-09 @Retro_1993 @SpawnWaveMedia Why go through all the effort to hide them? Sony and Nintendo do not hide them. Wheres  the Microsoft that is transparent and open with the consumer. We deserve to know how healthy their console business is.
2021-05-09 @Sir_Vamped @BananaBoyardee @DoNTcAReTB @SpawnWaveMedia Uhhh it is profitable. Microsoft has said they make back their profit with Xbox Live and digital game sales.You seem to care more about Xbox sales more than anyone else here tho. I assume you like Xbox?
2021-05-09 @MrThomasRayner In Microsoft's corporate clients, it's a polite question, to ask the person, if they're assigned to legacy. Some companies have PCs with less RAM than my phone or shared admin rdp where there would not have space for 2 like me.

2021-05-08 @Eski_Boi_ This is out of context. New games or current gen games are even. Microsoft just has a better solution for old games, where as the PS5 requires a full ported version. It's not like the PS5 couldn't do it

2021-05-08 @MikaDima1 @EhrgeizGT @Romudeth Gamepass is not profitable today because Microsoft is still investing in it to grow. That‚Äôs how all subscription services start, gamepass is not new in it. Looking at the trend and growth so far, the chances of gamepass failing are pretty slim.(5/5)

2021-05-08 @LonelyGoomba @parlyzhealed I mean look at Sony and Microsoft they are about the same tbh, sometimes worse. They ride on third party‚Äôs till the few games they make come out.
2021-05-08 @Piermaurizio1 @klobrille @vicious696 I think this is a bad way of looking at it though. With the amount of IP Microsoft now has, why change the fundamentals of Halo just to reach people that already aren‚Äôt interested? ‚ÄúDo what you do, but do it well‚Äù imo should be what 343i strives for.
2021-05-08 @MikaDima1 @EhrgeizGT @Romudeth What does that mean? Xbox earns an extra $18.5 bil every 5 years. Remember, Microsoft isn‚Äôt paying for the development of the third party games that come to gamepass, they‚Äôre only paying a certain fee to have those games in. (2/)

At $10 per month over 5 years, that‚Äôs 50*10*12*5, or 30 bil.(1/)

2021-05-08 Halo Infinite has been such a comedy of errors for years now. It‚Äôs fun to watch but also kind of concerning. Microsoft has bought damn near every studio they can get their mitts on, but what good will that do if they suck at managing first party development?
2021-05-08 @lilzukovert Exactly. Word just feels so much more fluid and swift. Even if I didn't have Word, it shouldn't be my second choice to use it. I'd rather use Word online which is free or Libre Office  ‚úãüò≠ But I commend google for making it free before Microsoft.
2021-05-08 @dralmaember Not a big concern apparently. Its not like devs are asking for it. Its just weird. Every other OS reached this *fairly* quickly. Microsoft even went down the one OS for all form factors route.

2021-05-08 @AnotherEsqInNYC @BooleanBarman @_ganderM @tomwarren That opens up a whole can of worms. Microsoft made money from selling Windows and Apple did charge for OS X updates at the time before including the App Store on OS X.

2021-05-08 @Romudeth There's nothing "irrational" about it. Its just Microsoft again trying to disrupt which they can't win at. Games don't age well like music, movies, books. It's a race to the bottom. News already came out of MS requiring indie games to be on XCloud. Don't take much.

2021-05-08 @vicious696 I have a option I‚Äôve said before for Sony. Make demos a thing for ps plus subs. I don‚Äôt think they can eat the cost of something like game pass Xbox isn‚Äôt currently making money from game pass it‚Äôs costing billions but Microsoft can take the hit. For Sony it‚Äôs a much bigger risk.

2021-05-08 @sniffstiel No not a fake just old. Microsoft didn‚Äôt used to do subscriptions. I think that started at some point in the 2010s. They used to do the single time buy on a CD but stoped because they realized they could make more money by requiring it to be renewed.

2021-05-08 As far as the hardware goes, xbox wins, almost the same but a few more terraflops and utter silence at the highest settings is a deal maker. As far as UI its no contest. Microsoft UI gets it done it 3 inouts or less most the time. PS5 somehow took a step backwards in that field.

2021-05-08 @Masterofmenall1 @Woofaki @PS5only Sony is stuck on one hardware which is PlayStation so of course they need a huge amount of console sales, Microsoft isn‚Äôt bound to one hardware like Sony.

2021-05-08 @robdelaney It's more informative to investigate the failures. Eg., Bill Gates probably can't tell you why Microsoft became so successful, because a lot of it came down to the right time and the right place. But if you look at all the companies that DIDN'T make it you might see a pattern...

2021-05-08 @Wario64 This shit makes me laugh, Microsoft brands a HDD or SSD and its automatically double the price of every drive of the same type &amp; size of other brands. You can get a 1Tb SSD for $90-120usd and a decent cheap USB 3.0/3.1 enclosure for $10-15usd. It will likely be faster too.
2021-05-08 @DoWhatYouDo6 @showbotics101 Who was asking and who was Microsoft testifying for? It was Epic.  They weren't forced to tell any truth they were there to testify on behalf of Epic why Apple charging 30% is not the same and anticompetitive.

2021-05-08 @Cosmycal @_h0x0d_ I think @Microsoft has still, in part, been building on UI/UX foundations that they REALLY ramped up the exploration on beginning circa 1998-1999. Maybe some of it just correlates by accident, or maybe data and trends have proved out shelved ideas. Probably a bit of both. =)

2021-05-08 @lucasthorn I like to pretend that every cent of the money I have ever given to Microsoft, directly and indirectly over the course of my life, all went towards about 20 minutes of tranquility to the Gateses while their marriage, which is none of anyone else's business really, came to an end.

2021-05-08 One thing that makes me appreciate often-frustrating Google software and services more is experiencing the awfulness of Microsoft software and services.
2021-05-08 Interestingly enough, that's exactly how Microsoft is run. They keep forcing us to "upgrade" software that's already working just fine- and in many instances, it just makes things worse!  (Hence, the quotes.)It's a heck of a business model, though, isn't it?

2021-05-08 @NBikcin @LordAddictILP They are remakes dawg not the same 360 game just running at 120 FPS. Developers actually redoing assets to take advantage of the hardware.

2021-05-08 I tweeted earlier this week that I found one aspect of Microsoft's testimony strange: That the Xbox console itself has never made money. It's generally understood consoles debut at a loss but end at a profit. Looks like Apple is equally suspicious.

2021-05-08 @camiluhcameelah The whole convo isn't that deep imo. I live below the poverty line so I use Google docs, libre office, whatever I get my hands on at the time. Microsoft is offered because it's needed to complete the coursework and curriculum is centered around it.
2021-05-08 @NuclearWessels Just the faulty updates from Microsoft... Irritating me. I'm definitely proLinux. But games keep me dual booting. Though I play what I can on Linux.
2021-05-08 BESIDES WE HAVE TO PAY FOR MICROSOFT WORD SO NAH IM GOOD
2021-05-08 @weirdoglitch They can also choose to pay what their business can afford to pay their employees. Walmart, Amazon and Target, Apple and Microsoft aren‚Äôt the only employers in this country. Lots of small town businesses that don‚Äôt even take in enough money to support $15 an hour employees.
2021-05-08 @pushsquare But you wanna push this is only going to be on PS5 for "x" amount of time....Sorry @Sony @PlayStation, @Microsoft kinda outdid ya this time...err..shall I say, you really shot yourself in the foot on this one
2021-05-08 @TM65Claw I think Microsoft already gave their stance like two E3's ago.
2021-05-08 @Vyprstryke @TravisBakonator @TR3VRAWR @johntv Unfortunately, Microsoft has staunchly refrained from making us a full publisher, so we were put in the ID@Xbox program where we aren't given the full range of freedom that other publishers have.

2021-05-08 @shitmydickoff @crisperstorm I wouldn't call Halo the flagship Xbox campaign anymore. Maybe fourteen years ago, you'd be right, the 360 generation got the kickstart it sorely needed because of Halo 3, but these days Microsoft has a massive catalog of exclusives from just the Bethesda buyout alone.
2021-05-08 @JoePFerguson Ideas: (1) Schedule the backup and copy in Task Scheduler or (2) try WSL Raft on the Microsoft Store for a snapshot tool, just to make process easier.

2021-05-08 @PeteCCDE Let's just say the early days of Microsoft's voice (OCS, Lync) were terrible and we still lost lots of deals anyways at Cisco.
2021-05-08 @BigSkyGuy57 @naomirwolf They already do this...Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Samsung, Etc, Etc, Etc....
2021-05-08 @Vyprstryke @TravisBakonator @TR3VRAWR @johntv While we are on Xbox, it's been extremely slow moving and we're not able to do everything on the platform. Microsoft hasn't given us full autonomy to select our own releases. We have to get approval for each release.

2021-05-08 @LambdaCore5 @crisperstorm The publisher is Microsoft, who wants to make a good exclusive for their consoles. The campaign absolutely matters, because PlayStation has infinite single player games that are really good, and Xbox wants to be able to compete

This + the fact they'll migrate 10X features to W10 instead, points to them in fact killing 10X

2021-05-07 @d_yeona @IGN PC isn't a closed ecosystem like the consoles, the  competition is so intense that even Sony wants a piece of the pie, even Microsoft is cutting down the profit margin of its store.Competition is always good for the customer.You can even sell your own game without a store.

2021-05-07 @4RayLee @Microsoft @github It's actually a fun and interesting rabbit hole to go digging through. I learned a lot, but not enough to help with a fix. Here is a good start to the rabbit hole.
2021-05-07 @windowscentral If W10X was just going to be a "lite" OS, similar to Chrome OS... Microsoft has made the right choice here. I'd rather see regular Windows 10 get all the TLC possible and made even better... and then maybe get it to the point where it can be the OS for devices like Neo.
2021-05-07 @p3nf0ld ¬£7.50 per user per month for the Power Apps per app plan. Netflix is ¬£9.99. I think it is a bargain. Microsoft also have different price for strategic enterprise customers which is less than the sticker price.
2021-05-07 @DominicJSnyder @avoblackfyre @Nathand86914897 @BenjiSales Microsoft sells their consoles at a loss, but charges essentially infinite markup on digital game downloads.

2021-05-07 Microsoft should absolutely deliver a ChomeOS-like device for enterprise!Most users need no more than a browser/thin apps to do their job. Take away the scripting engines and code execution and suddenly a massive portion of the attack surface vanishes.
2021-05-07 Because it's free (at least from kid's perspectives). Yes, most school divisions from K-12 on up have licensing deals in place with Microsoft, but in the age of Chromebooks, google docs has a smaller leaning curve.I can't imagine trying to write a Master's thesis on it though.

2021-05-07 @Optimus_Code I didn't dodge anything. To earn enough points to get gamepass isn't a option for me because I don't use alot of Microsoft products. I don't look for friends to buy something in order to try it. If my friends don't have it I won't try it till I'm comfortable to do so.

2021-05-07 @JakeAnbinder I would love to get rid of the Microsoft Suite, I don't use it in my personal life, and neither job has used it and I'm 45.  The only reason I don't is because of my non-working wife.
2021-05-07 Since 2018, i've been questioning the Gamepass service model.Now we now that Microsoft ain't getting shit from it.I was fine with the idea of Gamepass until they announced the day one releases.That shit don't make sense, and will never make sense for AAA games.

2021-05-07 @Optimus_Code @FrontlineGamer U a hardcore ponies. If Microsoft isn't reporting a lost why worry. It takes millions to invest into new tech . Billions to invest into cloud servers being placed in oceans all around the world. U don't build wealth over night. Everybody makes money it's what u do with it.
2021-05-07 @mehedih_ It was expected at some point and it's really repetitive. I won't ever be excited again if Microsoft ever announces something big and bold or "game changing"But I will also say that at least they try. Only if they tried first and announced later then that would be different.
2021-05-07 Also interesting that Word is an inferior program that Microsoft the monopolist gave away free as an added free program for years designed to eliminate WordPerfect, which was a far superior program at least for law offices. Does WP still even exist I wonder.

2021-05-07 It seems to me like they've overly underestimated how much some people badly reacted to the new combat system and that the game sold well especially because of said promotion by Microsoft, plus long-lasting fans (like me) buying the game because they trusted SEGA/RGG Studio.

2021-05-07 @JakeAnbinder As a millennial I have only ever used Microsoft Word when I wasn‚Äôt on the hook for the cost. Otherwise I‚Äôm just going to use the free product that does everything I need while enabling easy collaboration.
2021-05-07 @chiragshah Maybe because it would further strain the supply chain? Or maybe because nobody likes to give up their trade secret, even if it isn't monetizable by others. Ex: that I can never build MS office doesn't mean that Microsoft will be happy to give me the source code.
2021-05-07 @plainandlittle If you go on eBay, you can buy a licence for Microsoft Office much cheaper. When orgs get rid of their old machines with licences tied to them,  resellers buy up the machines and sell the codes.I've done it with no issue on my last 3 machines

2021-05-07 Did Microsoft just kill its answer to Chrome OS and¬†Chromebooks? 
2021-05-07 Man I'm all for Microsoft Word as much as the next guy but a whole generation grew up using docs. And Docs is free. No one wants to pay using that 140 dollar price tag. Even if your college let's you use it for free it's usually a limited feature version of Word. 
2021-05-07 Here me out though, has Microsoft considered not shoving every possible mediocre combination of utilities into their products and instead perhaps focusing on doing a smaller amount of things well? 
2021-05-07 A motion filed late Thursday by @Apple counsel asked the court to deem earlier testimony from @Xbox VP Lori Wright as not credible. They argue Microsoft withheld documents key to backing up her claims made in court Wednesday. #EpicvsApple

2021-05-07 @enjireiner YEAH IT IS. It would be smart for universities to like, create a joint venture with Microsoft to have Office Suite available to students at no cost, but they'd both lose money that way. And god forbid billion dollar companies lose any money. They might go under y'know üò¢

2021-05-07 @GewdvibesPlays @capt_cannon @oskool_g I agree with this. Microsoft‚Äôs pockets are deeper and it‚Äôs unthinkable how deep it is. They don‚Äôt really need the income for games. Due to making major profit off other things. Azure cloud is one being used by Sony and other major companies.

2021-05-07 @robthehermit @Rotmm @GodisaGeek I can agree with this. Been testing out it with a few different games today and I love it. This should be a standard on consoles going forward.

2021-05-07 @JasonSterlingRM That‚Äôs fair. I‚Äôm also a tomb Raider fan and Microsoft also leaked more than one TR release as well (one was supposed to be a surprise at the Square Enix event) so who knows. I honestly think MS are just bad at not publishing content early.
2021-05-07 @ImSarcasticPig @Dasmesee1 @im_a_slave1_0 @Rayman1024u @Saltiest_Gaming How can you say it makes profit when Microsoft have documents shoping it does not make a profit, of course it provides an income but that doesn't mean they don't have costs to provide the service that exceed that income, Sony have no plans for PS now to be similar to GamePass

2021-05-07 @kay_fil @JakeAnbinder I think Microsoft Word is worth the cost as a backup? It‚Äôs $69 and will last you at least a couple of years. Granted, I never use Pages but the wifi has gone out too much for me to rely solely on Docs. I also hate the interface of Docs but put up with it for editors‚Äô sake.

2021-05-07 @_h0x0d_ The biggest problem is @Microsoft needs to start eating it's own dog food again, and make all of it's apps for #Windows10 and not just for the web and then mobile platforms. If they would do that they would boost the store, and in turn allow things like Windows10X to come out.

2021-05-07 Announcing the new sharing experience 
2021-05-07 @C0URTNEYC0 Microsoft's solution to this is onedrive (i think that's what it's called). I taught in a district that required us to use Microsoft. It was very difficult for some to catch on. I had already moved on to Google. It's easier and it's free. I'm GenX btw.

2021-05-07 @NihilusShadow @Generalkidd Exactly but OG Xbox is just too old. Microsoft barely made any of OG games BC with 360 let alone ONE or Series X/S. They abandoned that system the minute the 360 was launched
2021-05-07 @AdamSinger I don‚Äôt know many big client side companies that use Google Docs‚Ä¶? Tend to be all in on the Microsoft ecosystem, if anything more likely to ban Docs as a security risk etc. but personally I much prefer Word anyway, especially with OneDrive auto save on.

2021-05-07 for those in the #tcp #iso stack this is an oldie and goodie; for those at @intel and @microsoft be sure to enjoy the colloquial approach to how we do things today, like we did 20-30 years ago.

2021-05-07 If you haven't already migrated apps to Teams from Skype, it's probably too late now...It's not an insignificant lift, and there's still a lot of things you can't do that you used to be able to do...But I will not miss UCWA in the slightest.

2021-05-07 It's been known for a while that Microsoft sells xboxs at a loss, but I think changing games to a subscription model was 5head and I'm glad they figured out a way to make this part of their business profitable.
